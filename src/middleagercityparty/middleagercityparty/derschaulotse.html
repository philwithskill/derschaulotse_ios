		    <h1>What Is GeekDevelopment</h1>
	        <p>The vernacular knows various words that describe what the 
members of GeekDevelopment are. IT professionals, software engineers, 
software developers, programmers. We would describe us as a bunch of 
people that fell in love with the possibilities that IT provides to all 
of us and the skillset that transforms these possibilities into cool 
realizations.</p>

		 		<h1>Tell Us Your Idea</h1>
   				<p class="lead">Did you ever had this idea people laughed about? 
Did you ever woke up in the middle of the night like, "Holy shit, this 
app would make the world such a better place"? Or you just sat on the 
toilet thinking, "Meh, that gadget would be kind of funny"? You see 
people grapple with problems and can't understand why nobody else can 
see this smart IT solution that is in your mind?</p>

				<p>Then feel free to share your idea with us. But why would you do that?</p>

				<p>Maybe you're a designer. Maybe you're a developer. Maybe you have
 valuable connections. Or maybe you're just dedicated to realize your 
idea. But unfortunately your lack of IT skills or manpower make it 
impossible for you to turn your idea into an awesome piece of software. 
Then we will offer our skills and manpower to help you getting things 
done.</p>

				<p>Give us a short description of your idea. Tell us what you can contribute to realize your idea and we will have a conversation.</p>

				<p>Our intention with this little project is to connect with young, 
dedicated and creative people, knowing that the world is theirs for the 
taking. People with good ideas and valuable skills in any kind that help
 to realize them.</p>

				<p>Every little idea you had is worth talking about. A cool, a smart, a funny or even a stupid idea.</p>
